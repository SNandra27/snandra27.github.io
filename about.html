                        <p class="font-weight-normal">I am a passionate UX Designer specialising in designing mobile apps and 
                        websites for people to fall in love with. 
                        <br><br>
                        I enjoy working independently as well as with a team where we can share our enthusiasm and bounce ideas 
                        of each other.</p>

                <h2>A Little Bit of History</h2>
                <p>I have come from a technical background where I spent my days coding using ASP.Net C#. After around
                10 years of this I felt it was time for a change, and decided to take a side step into the world of
                Quality Assurance. I found Quality Assurance very enjoyable especially the psychology behind why
                someone would do a certain thing when using a site/app and how depending on who it is, the result
                can change.</p>
                <p>Without consciously realising, I discovered UX Design and immediately fell in love. In order to gain
                more knowledge I have spent the past year studying many online courses and doing small projects to
                bring that knowledge to life. The studying won't end anytime soon, as I believe that is the key to
                keeping the passion alive and solving the problems in our constantly changing world.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row mb-4">
                <h2>My Mission</h2>
                <p>As UX Design continues to fascinate me, I would like to really start making a positive impact on
                people's lives and help them fall in love with the websites and mobile apps they use, whether that's once in a
                while or everyday. A good experience means they will keep on coming back. How do I know this? Because I am
                one of them. By making this personal, I can empathise with my users and put myself in their shoes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row mb-4">
                <h2>More About Me</h2>
                <p>When I am not trying to save the world one UX design at a time, I love to lose myself in a good book,
                play music very loud, or get outside and hike amongst the nature. Socialising with my friends and
                family is also very important to me, and it usually involves a large amount of food and laughter.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row mb-4">
                <h2>What's Next</h2>
                <p>Right now I would like to be part of a team who share my passion for UX Design, where we can bounce
                ideas of each other and together keep improving each other and the work that we do. I would like to be able to
                make contributions to the company that I work for, so that the difference is felt by the users in many years to
                come. In the near future, I would like to further my knowledge and passion by studying for a Masters.</p>
