                <h5>A Little Bit of History</h5>
                <p>I have come from a technical background where I spent my days coding using ASP.Net C#. After around
                10 years of this I felt it was time for a change, and decided to take a side step into the world of
                Quality Assurance. I found Quality Assurance very enjoyable especially the psychology behind why and 
                how users perform differently.</p>
                <p>Through QA, I discovered UX Design and immediately fell in love. In order to gain
                more knowledge I have since then spent studying many online courses and doing small projects to
                bring that knowledge to life.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row mb-4">
                <h5>What Now?</h5>
                <p>As UX Design continues to fascinate me, I would like to keep making a positive impact on
                people's lives and help them fall in love with the websites and mobile apps they use. I am now available to 
                join a company where I can make many contributions so that the difference is felt by the users in many years to come. </p>
            </div>

            <!-- <div class="row mb-4">
                <h2>More About Me</h2>
                <p>When I am not trying to save the world one UX design at a time, I love to lose myself in a good book,
                play music very loud, or get outside and hike amongst the nature. Socialising with my friends and
                family is also very important to me, and it usually involves a large amount of food and laughter.</p>
            </div> -->

            <!-- <div class="row mb-4">
                <h2>What's Next</h2>
                <p>Right now I would like to be part of a team who share my passion for UX Design, where we can bounce
                ideas of each other and together keep improving each other and the work that we do. I would like to be able to
                make contributions to the company that I work for, so that the difference is felt by the users in many years to
                come. In the near future, I would like to further my knowledge and passion by studying for a Masters.</p>
