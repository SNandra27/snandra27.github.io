                <h2>A Little Bit of History</h2>
                <p>I have come from a technical background where I spent my days coding using ASP.Net C#. After around
                    10 years of this I felt it was time for a change, and decided to take a side step into the world of
                    Quality Assurance. I found Quality Assurance very enjoyable especially the psychology behind why
                    someone would do a certain thing when using a site/app and how depending on who it is, the result
                    can change.</p>
                <p>Without consciously realising, I discovered UX Design and immediately fell in love. In order to gain
                    more knowledge I have spent the past year studying many online courses and doing small projects to
                    bring that knowledge to life. The studying won't end anytime soon, as I believe that is the key to
                    keeping the passion alive and we are in an everyday changing world.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row mb-5 px-2">
                <h2>My Mission</h2>
                <p>As UX Design continues to fascinate me, I would like to really start making a positive impact on
                    people's lives and help them fall in love with the sites and apps they use, whether that's once in a
                    while or everyday. A good experience means they will keep on coming back. How do I know this? I am
                    one of them. By making this personal, I can empathise with my users and put myself in their shoes.
                </p>

            <div class="row mb-5 px-2">
                <h2>More About Me</h2>
                <p>When I am not trying to save the world one UX design at a time, I love to lose myself in a good book,
                    play music very loud, or get outside and hike amongst the nature. Socialising with my friends and
                    family is also very important to me, and it usually involves a large amount of food and laughter.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="row mb-5 px-2">
                <h2>What's Next</h2>
                <p>Right now I would like to be part of a team who share my passion for UX Design, where we can bounce
                    ideas of each other and together keep improving each other and the work that we do. One day in the
                    near future, I would like to further my knowledge and passion by studying for a Masters.</p>
