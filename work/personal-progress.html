                <h2>Step 1: Understand & Empathise</h2>
                <p>My client wanted a website to display information regarding his work in Life Coaching and Sports and
                    Remedial Massage. He deals with many customers who come to him in either physical pain or
                    emotionally unstable, sometimes both. My client didn't have much experience in how the website
                    should look in the best way for his customers to see which would make them then want to contact him
                    for a session. Therefore it was left up to me to advise.</p>
                <p>The first thing I understood regarding this type of website was that the customers viewing may be in
                    an anxious, impatient and stressed manner, therefore a simple website, with calming colours,
                    displaying the treatment and contact information clearly was the most vital point.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row mb-5 px-2">

                <h2>Step 2: Research and Analyse</h2>
                <p>I started this phase by interviewing my client, his wants and needs. If there was a preference of how
                    he wanted the website to look, desktop only, and what he wanted to achieve from the website. I then
                    moved onto to interviewing his existing customers. This was a challenging task as some of his
                    customers weren't willing to be contacted and preferred to remain confidential. So after much
                    thought I decided me interviewing then wouldn't work. I decided to create a quick questionnaire
                    where the customer's were asked to fill in by client when they popped in for their appointments.</p>
                <p>There was 2 points I beared in mind. Firstly, his customers didn't know me therefore wouldn't trust
                    me as much as they trust their client, purely because of the nature of this work, so it was better
                    he presented the questionnaire. Secondly, the clients would be coming to these appointments either
                    in a distressed manner or in physical pain, and usually eager to either get started, and eager to
                    leave after the appointment, therefore the questionnaire had to be simple, to the point, and kept
                    short.</p>
                <p>Other research including investigating 'Osteopath' and 'Counselling' type websites, to see their
                    designs, and the way information was displayed. I also did a thorough research in colour psychology,
                    typography, and images for this particular type of website. Using my findings I always feel creating
                    a moodboard helps me decide on the designs. Once I felt I had enough information about the customers
                    needs gathered, I created my user personas.</p>

            <div class="row mb-5 px-2">
                <div class="col-md-2"></div>
                <div class="col-md-8 text-center">
                    <img src="/img/personalprogressmoodboard.png" class="rounded img-fluid center-block shadow" alt="Personal Progress">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-2"></div>
            </div>

            <div class="row mb-5 px-2">

                <h2>Step 3: Planning & Design</h2>
                <p>My favourite stage, I collaborated all the information I collected from my research and user profiles to understand my audience and their needs. From this I was able to map out a sitemap, at first a very rough one to see which information goes where, keeping in mind the information needed to be easy to find, as the nature of the website, clients would be using this when possibly stressed or in pain.</p>
                <p>Once the sitemap was in place, I used Balsamiq to create wireframes. This allowed me further imagine where everything would go, and I was able to show my client the design ideas, without having to dwell too much on features like colours, typography, and images. For now, I wanted my client to be happy with what he would see layout wise.</p>
                <p>I created a quick prototype in Axure for my client to see how the menu would work, and what buttons would lead where. This allowed my client to get a feel of how his website would work as well as more idea of what it would look like as I added in colours and links. After using the prototype, my client felt more confident in knowing what he would get, and we were able to proceed with the website.</p>

                <h2>Step 4: Implement & Evaluate</h2>
                <p>As with all projects, feedback went back and forth, and we worked together to create the best possible website for my client. We wanted the webiste to look very clean, calming colours and responsive. I decided on the images and colours after the research of other similar websites, where pastel colours and no dark backgrounds created a more calming effect. It was important the website was responsive as we wanted customers to be able to view on their phones and for it to look presentable.</p>
                <p>The information has been kept very minimal as I found in my research people looking for this kind of information dont want to spend a lot of time reading about it, they would like to know enough to understand this is the right direction, and then would prefer to pick up the phone to ask for more detail or just book an appointment and speak in person, again I feel this is because of the nature of the website.</p>
                <p>I recommended to my client to add Google Analytics to the website, so we could track how many people come on to his website from where. As he has links on his social media pages, this made the findings more interesting, and he was able to concentrate on improving the places people weren't coming from as much. We could also see how people used his website, and which pages weren't so used. All this data would help improve my client's website in the future if he wished to further develop it.</p>
