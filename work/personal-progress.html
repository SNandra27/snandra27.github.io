                        <p class="text-justify font-weight-normal">This is a website to gain knowledge about life coaching 
                        services, and sports massages. This was a freelance project, where I managed the research, and low 
                        and high fidelity designs.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify font-weight-normal">As well as hand sketches, I used Balsamiq for the low fidelity 
                        wireframes, and Axure for the high fidelity wireframes and prototypes. Photoshop was mainly used for 
                        any imagery work.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify font-weight-normal">The website was then developed in Wordpress and deployed live 
                        by a developer. Wordpress was chosen so the maintenance of the content could be handled by the client 
                        himself post live deployment.<br><br>

                <h4>Task at Hand</h4>
                <p>A website was needed to display information regarding the services offered in Life Coaching and Sports
                Massages. The problem my client had was he felt the number of further enquiries he was receiving was much lower 
                considering the high volume of visitors on his website. He wanted to improve these numbers which would result in
                potential customers feeling more confident in him after exploring his website to then want to contact him for 
                an appointment.</p>
                    
                <p>After looking at his website, I found his information was useful, but just not separated into useful sections on 
                the website, making it hard to navigate around. I also found his contact information only on the 'Contact' page,
                which meant users were having to come off the page they were viewing, resulting in them possibly getting distracted</p>          
            </div>

            <div class="row mb-4">
                <div class="col-md-5 pt-4">
                    <h4>Research and Analysis</h4>
                    <p>I started this phase by interviewing my client to find out whether he had a preference of how he wanted the 
                    website to look, what kind of information he wanted to share, and what he wanted to achieve from the website. 
                    After discussing this, together we decided we would create a responsive website that would be interchangeable 
                    between desktop and mobile view in order to fit the clients and users criteria.</p>

                    <p>For this project I wanted to interview the current clientele, however due to the kind of treatments the users were
                    seeing my client for, they preferred to remain anonymous and only deal with my client. Thus, I could not meet them in 
                    person or talk to them directly. As a creative strategy to overcome this, I took a “survey” response, where I left 
                    surveys for the users to fill at their appointments, that contained a multitude of questions to help me define the 
                    issues they needed solving and how to best design them a seamless experience using the product.</p>

            <div class="row mb-5 pt-3">

                    <img src="/img/personalprogressmoodboard.png" alt="Personal Progress" class="rounded img-fluid shadow">
                </div>
                
                <div class="col-md-0"></div>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>From my surveys, I examined his current customers and discovered my users would be local to the 
                    clinic, in a 5 mile radius, and I found the age group to be mainly between two groups. Ages ranging between 30-60 
                    years. Due to the nature of the services, I was also interested in users' lifestyles, which included their jobs. 
                    This is because of today's busy work schedules are known to be a big cause in stress and anxiety, two of the 
                    biggest issues my client helps with. Using this information helped me create some user personas</p>

                    <p>Next, it was imperative I studied and analysed the products offering similar services available, as my 
                    market research. This way I could see the experience they offered me, if it was common to show prices, how did I find
                    the answers to my questions as a potential customer. Part of the research was to also look at the imagery used, 
                    typography, font sizes, common colours to name a few. This allowed me to see what calls out to users similar to mine 
                    and what is usable and functional for them. Once this was done, I always found creating a moodboard at this stage 
                    helped me gather my thoughts around colours, images, and font types.</p>

                    <h4>Persona, Planning and Design</h4>
                    <p>I collaborated all the information I collected from my research and user profiles to understand my audience 
                    and their needs. From this I was able to map out a sitemap, at first a very rough one to see which information 
                    goes where, keeping in mind the information needed to be easy to find, as the nature of the website, clients 
                    would be using this when possibly stressed or in pain.</p>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>Once the sitemap was in place, I used Balsamiq to create wireframes. This allowed me to further imagine where 
                    everything would go, and I was able to show my client the design ideas, without having to dwell too much on 
                    features like colours, typography, and images. For now, I wanted my client to be happy with what he would see 
                    layout wise.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="row mb-4 px-3">
                <p>I created a quick prototype in Axure for my client to see how the menu would work, and what buttons would lead 
                where. This allowed my client to get a feel of how his website would work as well as more idea of what it would 
                look like as I added in colours and links. After using the prototype, my client felt more confident in knowing 
                what he would get, and we were able to proceed with the website.</p>

            <div class="row mb-4 px-3">
                <h4>Implement & Evaluate</h4>
                <p>As with all projects, feedback went back and forth, and we worked together to create the best possible website for 
                my client. We wanted the website to look very minimal, with calming colours and clear typography. I decided on the 
                images and colours after the research of other similar websites, where pastel colours and no dark backgrounds 
                created a more calming effect. It was important the website was responsive as we wanted customers to be able to 
                view on their phones and for it to look presentable.</p>

                <p>The information has been kept very basic and to the point as I found in my research people looking for this kind 
                of information dont want to spend a lot of time reading about it, they would like to know enough to understand 
                this is the right direction, and then would prefer to pick up the   phone to ask for more detail or just book an 
                appointment and speak in person, again I feel this is because of the nature of the website.</p>

                <p>I recommended to my client to add Google Analytics to the website, so we could track how many people visit 
                his website. As he has many social media accounts, this would make the findings more interesting to see where his 
                advertising really work for him. This would also help us to see how people used his website. My client has noticed
                an increase in the number of people who reach out to him via email. This shows many people find it more confortable
                to make contact without having to speak to someone. He has also noticed a difference in the questions his potential
                customers ask him, already understanding the basic information, and looking for some further details.</p>
