                <h2>Step 1: Who are the Users? Understanding and Empathising</h2>
                <p>My client wanted a website to display information regarding his work in Life Coaching and Sports and
                    Remedial Massage. He deals with many customers who come to him in either physical pain or
                    emotionally unstable, sometimes both. My client didn't have much experience in how the website
                    should look in the best way for his customers to see which would make them then want to contact him
                    for a session. Therefore it was left up to me to advise. The current problem was, the users were still quite
                    confused what kind of services were offered, despite them looking on the website, it was quite hard to navigate
                    around, and to find the information, as well as contact details easily.</p>
                <!-- <p>The first thing I understood regarding this type of website was that the customers viewing may be in
                    an anxious, impatient and stressed manner, therefore a simple website, with calming colours,
                    displaying the treatment and contact information clearly was the most vital point.</p> -->
                    <P>In order to know my users, I looked into his current customers and discovered my users would be local to the 
                        clinic, in a 5 mile radius, and I found the age group to be mainly between 2 groups. Either between 30-40 
                        years, or over 60. Due to the nature of the services, I was also interested in users' lifestyles, which 
                        included their jobs. This is because of today's busy work schedules are known to be a big cause in stress 
                        and anxiety, 2 of the biggest issues my client helps with.
                    </P>
            </div>

            <div class="row mb-5 px-2">

                <h2>Step 2: Research and Analysis</h2>
                <p>I started this phase by interviewing my client which included getting to know his wants and needs. 
                    I wanted to know if there was a preference of how he wanted the website to look, what kind of 
                    information he to share, and what he wanted to achieve from the website. For this brief I created a responsive 
                    product that would be interchangeable between desktop and mobile view in order to fit the clients and users criteria.
                    For this project I wanted to interview users, however, due to confidentiality and the fact that many users are in 
                    physical pain, I was only able to access the users through the client. Thus, I could not meet them in person or 
                    talk to them directly. As a creative strategy to overcome this, I took a “survey” response, where I sent out a 
                    survey to the users that contained a multitude of questions that would help me define the issues they needed 
                    solving and how to best design them a seamless experience using the product. I asked questions such as; Would they
                    like to see prices of the services offered online? Would they prefer to read about the coach before committing
                    to an appointment. What's their preference when making contact, call or email?</p>
                <p>Other research including investigating 'Osteopath' and 'Counselling' type websites, to see their
                    designs, and the way information was displayed. I also did a thorough research in colour psychology,
                    typography, and images for this particular type of website. Using my findings I always feel creating
                    a moodboard helps me decide on the designs. Once I felt I had enough information about the customers
                    needs gathered, I created my user personas.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="row mb-5 px-2">
                <div class="col-md-2"></div>
                <div class="col-md-8 text-center">
                    <img src="/img/personalprogressmoodboard.png" class="rounded img-fluid center-block shadow" alt="Personal Progress">

                <div class="col-md-2"></div>
            </div>

            <div class="row mb-5 px-2">

                <h2>Step 3: Persona, Planning and Design</h2>
                <p>I collaborated all the information I collected from my research and user profiles to understand my audience 
                    and their needs. From this I was able to map out a sitemap, at first a very rough one to see which information 
                    goes where, keeping in mind the information needed to be easy to find, as the nature of the website, clients 
                    would be using this when possibly stressed or in pain.</p>

                    <div class="row mb-5 px-2">
                        <div class="col-md-2"></div>
                        <div class="col-md-8 my-2 text-center">
                            <img src="/img/personalprogresssitemap.png" class="rounded img-fluid center-block shadow"
                                alt="Personal Progress Sitemap">
                        </div>           
                        <div class="col-md-2"></div>
                    </div>
                <p>Once the sitemap was in place, I used Balsamiq to create wireframes. This allowed me further imagine where 
                    everything would go, and I was able to show my client the design ideas, without having to dwell too much on 
                    features like colours, typography, and images. For now, I wanted my client to be happy with what he would see 
                    layout wise.</p>
                <p>I created a quick prototype in Axure for my client to see how the menu would work, and what buttons would lead 
                    where. This allowed my client to get a feel of how his website would work as well as more idea of what it would 
                    look like as I added in colours and links. After using the prototype, my client felt more confident in knowing 
                    what he would get, and we were able to proceed with the website.</p>

                <h2>Step 4: Implement & Evaluate</h2>
                <p>As with all projects, feedback went back and forth, and we worked together to create the best possible website for 
                    my client. We wanted the website to look very minimal, with calming colours and clear typography. I decided on the 
                    images and colours after the research of other similar websites, where pastel colours and no dark backgrounds 
                    created a more calming effect. It was important the website was responsive as we wanted customers to be able to 
                    view on their phones and for it to look presentable.</p>
                <p>The information has been kept very basic and to the point as I found in my research people looking for this kind 
                    of information dont want to spend a lot of time reading about it, they would like to know enough to understand 
                    this is the right direction, and then would prefer to pick up the phone to ask for more detail or just book an 
                    appointment and speak in person, again I feel this is because of the nature of the website.</p>
                <p>I recommended to my client to add Google Analytics to the website, so we could track how many people visit 
                    his website. As he has many social media accounts, this would make the findings more interesting to see where his 
                    advertising really work for him. This would also help us to see how people used his website. My client has noticed
                    an increase in the number of people who reach out to him via email. This shows many people find it more confortable
                    to make contact without having to speak to someone. He has also noticed a difference in the questions his potential
                    customers ask him, already understanding the basic information, and looking for some further details.</p>
