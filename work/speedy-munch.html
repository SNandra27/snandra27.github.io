                    <p class="text-justify">A phone app for university students to order local food 24 hours a day. This was a passion
                        project I decided to do similar to apps like Just Eat, but from a slightly different angle targeting only local
                        places and for University students only, making them a priority.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I decided to do the wireframes and prototype on Axure. As well as using Photoshop for the images and Miro
                        for the planning.

                <h4>Who are the Users? Understanding and Empathising</h4>
                <p>A phone app was needed for busy, hungry students at university, for ordering fast, cheap food from local 
                delivery places. Students also needed the functionality of being able to choose a time they can have the food 
                delivered, to work around their busy schedule.</p>

                <p>Students of course were also able to pick up their collection in case they were out already. There are many 
                food delivering apps already available, which students use, but what made this one different is it only targeted 
                restaurants that are open 24 hours, which saves students having to check multiple restaurants and getting frustrated 
                when they see it’s closed.</p>

                    <h4>Research and Analysis</h4>
                    <li>In order to carry out my research for this app, I spoke to university students who lived on campus. From this I 
                    found out what a student’s schedule is like, how busy they are, and the times they are likely to want meals.</li><br>
                    <li>I asked them what kind of food they were interested in, and when ordering food, what was a priority out of 
                    quality, budget, and variety</li>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row mb-1">
                <div class="col-md-5 px-0">
                    <h4>Interview - Results</h4>
                    <li>I found out, as expected, budget was a high priority, and also the ease of being able to quickly order without
                    too much fuss. This made me consider how the app should have an account for the user, as then they are able to 
                    have a list of the restaurants they use a lot, which saves them searching.</li><br>

                    <li>I also spoke to a few 24 hour places around the university, and was firstly surprised to find there are quite a 
                    few, knowing their business is around the students. I found out from owners they were happy to deliver for free as 
                    long as it was over a certain amount, but made sense the amount would be kept fairly low as they are delivering 
                    locally and know students have a lower bill as they often order just for themselves.</li><br>

                    <li>For me, speaking to the people who would be involved is my best research, as I am getting first-hand information 
                    from the ones who know the business. In order to help with my designs, I created a mood board and some user personas.</li>

                <h4>Persona, Planning and Design</h4>
                <p>I find doing sitemaps for apps much more exciting than websites, however useful for both of them.
                    When doing this sitemap, I felt like I was really inside the app, as if I was already using it.
                    Having to imagine what I would do from this screen, and if I had more than 1 option was something I
                    felt I had to ask myself on each step, as well as going back to previous screens. </p>
                <p>I learnt how much this app could actually broaden in the future, and by going through the sitemap, I
                    found I can expand the business even if right now it may be out of scope. I decided to use Axure for
                    my sitemap which I find clean and easy to use.</p>

                <h4>Implement & Evaluate</h4>
                <p>I have used Balsamiq quite a lot for low fidelity wireframes, therefore decided to use Axure for a
                    change. Both equally powerful software as each other, however a different result which can be useful
                    in some cases, or just a new look. I liked the idea of once being logged into your account, the user
                    can feel it’s a bit more personalised by having a picture of themselves uploaded and appears as
                    their profile picture.</p>
                <p>I decided to keep the look of this app very simple, showing many pictures of food as I feel this
                    entices people to order more, especially if they are only a bit hungry. Lots of images, description
                    of the menu items was the way to go. Once the wireframes were all done, I proceeded to my prototype
                    which I find highly important in order to see how the app will feel as the user journeys through,
                    this I found Axure amazing for.</p>
